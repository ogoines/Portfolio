## 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
This project displays my portfolio for potential employers in my career search.   The portfolio is displayed on a webpage, which includes and image of me, sections about me, what I am currently doing and samples of projects.

The repository is held on GitHub under the name PortfolioProject.
The website was built using HTML and styled with Cascading Style Sheets and is published at https://ogoines.github.io/PortfolioProject/

The html document contains both global and local settings and is design to ensure that the pages are responsive, resizing  and are viewable on devices such as desktop, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.  

## Page Layout
The top of the page contains a header with my name and a greeting on the left side.   On the right side of the header is a navigation bar that contains links to sections about me, what I do, and contact information.  Navigational links were used to move to corresponding sections of the page.  Directly under is a full sized image of me. The main section contains the "about me" and "what I do" sections in a left side panel.  A middle section, which is the largest display link, contains my first website with a link to deploy.   To the right of that is a section that displays images of two other websites that have not yet deployed. Finally, horizontally displayed at the bottom is a contact link which includes my email address.  

# Lessons Learned
While styling the website I set the width to maximum on headers and the height to auto so that the browser would do most of the work for resizing the images and displays.   This was particularly challenging for me because it was counter-intuitive to what I would normally want to do, which is to decrease the size so that it fits the page!
